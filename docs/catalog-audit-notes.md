# GuardOath catalog audit coordination notes

## Batch 1 — non-privacy UC003, UC005, UC006, UC007

The manifest now records statuses and exact code/test/eval evidence for these four cases. `partial` means a bounded portion of the requested capability exists; `not_implemented` means the requested end-to-end capability is not present, even if adjacent safety components exist. No checker or eval suite was changed.

| ID | Status | Evidence summary |
|---|---|---|
| UC003 | partial | `guardoath/text_security.py`; `test_hidden_control_signals`, `test_legitimate_text_and_unlabeled_data`; `controls.zero_width_space.input`, `controls.bidi_override.input`, `scope.emoji_joiner.input` in text-security suite |
| UC005 | not_implemented | `guardoath/text_security.py`; `test_legitimate_text_and_unlabeled_data`; `scope.plain_attack_not_detected.input` documents a local semantic coverage gap |
| UC006 | not_implemented | `guardoath/tool_calls.py`; `test_plain_code_is_not_treated_as_validated_action_safety`, `test_the_entire_batch_cannot_invoke_tools_or_use_network`; dedicated eval ID: unknown / none identified |
| UC007 | partial | `guardoath/ingress.py`, `guardoath/budgets.py`, `guardoath/json_data.py`; `test_http_rejects_oversize_before_request_validation`, `test_parser_limits`, `test_token_bucket_refills_caps_and_rounds_retry`, `test_real_api_concurrency_limits_and_cancellation_cleanup`; dedicated eval ID: unknown / none identified |

## Out-of-scope changes requested

- `guardoath/coverage_report.py` currently recognizes a fixed status vocabulary. It should accept `not_implemented` and `supported` (or the manifest should use the original vocabulary consistently). This file is not Atlas-owned. Owner should reconcile the status vocabulary before the coverage reporter is treated as authoritative.
- Verify whether `UC006` warrants a dedicated negative eval case in a newly created suite, rather than treating proposed-tool-call checks as a sandbox control.
- This audit does not change privacy cases reserved for the later coordinated commit.

## Release discipline

All updates are additive to catalog metadata and tests. No tests or existing eval cases were deleted, skipped, or weakened. CI is the verification source; no local clone was used.

## CI reconciliation after first batch

Tests #175 exposed a status-vocabulary incompatibility with `guardoath/coverage_report.py` and `tests/test_coverage_report.py`. Catalog entries UC005/UC006 now retain canonical `review_required` status and record `audit_classification: not_implemented` with negative evidence. This avoids editing the unowned reporter or weakening its tests. UC003/UC007 remain `partial`.

Independent baseline failures on `test_configuration.py::test_pii_checker_loads_only_its_declared_dependencies` (Cython modules already imported) and three dashboard assertions were also observed; those files are reserved and were not changed. Owner of commit B should investigate. Audit work should not claim green CI while these failures remain.
